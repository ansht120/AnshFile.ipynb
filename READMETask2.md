# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task2 – car price prediction

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a car using features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine details.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Train-Test Split, Evaluation Metrics)

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Imported the dataset using Pandas  
2. Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualized relationships using charts  
5. Encoded categorical variables  
6. Selected important features  
7. Trained Machine Learning models  
8. Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²  
9. Predicted car selling prices using the trained model  

## 📈 Outcome
The **Random Forest Regressor** provided strong accuracy and predicted car prices reliably based on the given features.
