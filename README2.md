# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task2 – Sales Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Create a machine learning model to predict sales using factors like MRP, outlet size, item type, and outlet location.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset
2. Cleaned missing values and duplicates
3. Performed EDA and plotted visualizations
4. Encoded categorical variables
5. Trained ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
6. Evaluated using MSE, MAE, RMSE, R²
7. Predicted sales for new data

## 📈 Outcome
The Random Forest model performed best and produced accurate sales predictions.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install the required libraries
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Colab
3. Run all cells

## 📁 Files Included
- Dataset (CSV)
- SalesPredict.ipynb
